Most commonly, lifters do not do a 4th attempt. Even if they do, it won't be considered in their \"Best Lift\" for that category. But what if the 4th lift was better? Our main goal is to predict how strong a new lifter will be. So, we probably should consider a lifter's 4th attempt if it was stronger than their official best."

It turns out that logically, it is ok if we have multiple entries for the same lifters. If a lifter did happen to get stronger, then it is likely that other features changed as well. What if they got older? What if they were stronger when they were younger? What if they gained weight? What if they got taller/shorter? These changes would all capture any changes in strength for a certain person. Because of this, it is fine if we have multiple entries for the same lifter! We can just go ahead and remove the Name column for runtime/simplicity."
